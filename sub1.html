<h1>History</h1>
<p> The Automotive Transportation Service Superintendents' Association (ATSSA, or more commonly referred to as simply the 'ATS') was formed in 1938, and was incorporated on 20th of March 1940; which in turn gave birth to the Canadian Fleet Maintenance Seminar in 1963. In 1938 Ted Ashworth (pictured right), who was actively involved in the mechanical end of fleet operations, felt the need for forming some kind of organization of fleet maintenance supervisors with similar interests and objectives. He assembled nine of his colleagues and they discussed forming a 'Club' or 'Association' dedicated to the mutual benefit of personnel directly responsible for the maintenance of truck fleets. Thus the ATSSA was formed in Toronto and by March 1940 the Toronto chapter received its charter. Membership continued to grow and in 1943 it was decided to expand the category of members to include OEM businesses and their named individual representatives contributing or associated with the fleet maintenance industry.</p>
